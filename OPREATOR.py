# ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR
# a = 20  # =
# a += 5  # +=  It means same as a=a+5
# a -= 5  # -=  It means same as a=a-5
# a *= 5  # *=  It means same as a=a*5

# a %= 5  # %=  It means same as a=a%5
# a //= 5  #  It means same as a=a//5
# a **= 5  #  **= It means samse as a=a**5

# print(a)


# COMPARISON OPERATOR (True , False)

# print(3 == 4)  # equal to
